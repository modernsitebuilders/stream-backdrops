// PLATFORM VOCABULARY — the "where will you use it" axis of discovery.
//
// A platform is NOT an image filter. Every background is a 16:9 PNG that works
// identically on Zoom, Teams, Meet, and Webex, so the platform dimension never
// changes which images appear — it changes the INTENT and the COPY:
//   - a unique title/description/H1 targeting "{platform} backgrounds" queries
//   - platform-specific setup steps (rendered visibly AND as HowTo schema)
//   - platform-specific FAQs
//
// This is what makes /zoom-backgrounds/office and /google-meet-backgrounds/office
// legitimately distinct pages rather than duplicates: they answer different
// searches ("zoom office background" ≠ "google meet office background") with
// genuinely different setup guidance, while sharing the same curated image grid.
//
// Field contract:
//   slug        URL segment (/{slug}) + /{slug}/{theme}. Matches the head query.
//   name        Full product name. ("Microsoft Teams")
//   shortName   Compact name for tight UI. ("Teams")
//   queryWord   How the platform appears in a title before "Backgrounds".
//   eyebrow     Uppercase kicker.
//   title       Landing-page <title>. 20–65 chars (validated).
//   description Landing-page meta description. 110–160 chars (validated).
//   h1          Landing-page H1.
//   intro       Array of platform-specific body paragraphs (landing page).
//   setupHeading / setupSteps   Rendered how-to + HowTo schema.
//   faqs        Platform-specific Q&A (visible + FAQPage schema).
//   featuredCategories  Category slugs surfaced as "works great for {platform}".
