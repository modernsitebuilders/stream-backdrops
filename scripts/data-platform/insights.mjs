// Reusable analytics dashboard over the Neon mirror of the first-party event log.
// Run: `npm run insights`  (loads DATABASE_URL from .env.local via the npm script)
//
// ⚠️ TIMEZONE: Neon's session TZ is UTC, but the business (and the Google Sheet
// system of record) is US Eastern. Every day/week/hour rollup here buckets with
// `event_at AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'` so calendar boundaries match ET.
// Do NOT use a bare `date_trunc('day', event_at)` — that buckets in UTC and
// spills post-8pm-ET activity into the next day (the "data for tomorrow" bug).
//
// "Downloads" = any successful image use across surfaces (free download variants,
// in-Zoom apply, Meet add-on, email-bonus, free-sample), mirroring DOWNLOAD_EVENTS
// in lib/analyticsNormalize.js. "Revenue" = the money events in REVENUE_EVENTS
// there (kept separate — their filename is a product-id list, not a per-image use).
// Keep DL and REV below in sync with those two sets.
